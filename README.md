Dart Mathematical Operations
This directory contains Dart programs that perform basic mathematical operations on two-digit numbers.

üìÅ Files Description
1. Digit_Summation.dart
A simple Dart program that:

Takes two numbers (each of two digits).

Extracts the last digit from each number.

Calculates and prints the sum of the two last digits.

Example:

Input: 12 and 13 ‚Üí Last digits are 2 and 3 ‚Üí Sum = 5.

2. Arithmetic_Operators.dart
A Dart program that:

Takes three numbers and calculates the value of a fourth number using Arithmetic Operators.

You must use +, -, *, and / operators without repeating any operator.

Combines pairs of numbers with one operator at a time to reach a final value.

Focus: Practice using different arithmetic operators in one program.

3. Sort_Three_Numbers.dart
A Dart program that:

Takes three numbers as input.

Sorts and prints them in ascending order (smallest to largest).

A simple practice of conditional statements and sorting logic.
